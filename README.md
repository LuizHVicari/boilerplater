## Architecture

### Clean Architecture Structure

The codebase follows Clean Architecture principles with clear layer separation:

- **Domain Layer**: Contains business entities and domain models with pure business logic
- **Application Layer**: Orchestrates business logic through ports (interfaces) and adapters (implementations)
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Handles external concerns like database schemas and GraphQL definitions
- **Common**: Shared application logic and cross-cutting concerns

### Key Patterns

- **Unit of Work**: Transactional operations across repositories
- **Repository Pattern**: Separated command/query responsibilities
- **Domain Models**: Rich objects with encapsulated business logic
- **Dependency Injection**: NestJS IoC container for loose coupling

## Database

### Schema Management

The project uses Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations:

```bash
# After modifying schema files
pnpm run db:generate        # Create migration files
pnpm run db:migrate         # Apply migrations to database

# For development iterations
pnpm run db:push            # Direct schema sync (skips migrations)
```

### Database Studio

Access the visual database editor:

```bash
pnpm run db:studio
```

## Code Quality & Development Standards

### Comments Policy

**STRICT NO-COMMENTS POLICY**: Never add comments to code unless they are docstrings and only when explicitly requested. Code should be self-documenting through:
- Clear variable and function names
- Well-structured code organization
- Meaningful domain models and interfaces
- Proper separation of concerns

### Git Flow Workflow

This project follows a custom Git Flow with specific branch naming and targeting rules:

**Branch Types**:
- **main**: Production branch (protected)
- **dev**: Development integration branch
- **feat/[description]**: New features ‚Üí targets `dev`
- **bugfix/[description]**: Bug fixes ‚Üí targets `dev`
- **hotfix/[description]**: Urgent production fixes ‚Üí targets `main`
- **release/[version]**: Release preparation ‚Üí targets `main`

**Examples**:
- `feat/jwt-refresh-tokens`
- `bugfix/login-validation`
- `hotfix/security-patch`

### Performance Targets

The template is designed with specific performance goals:
- **Authentication Operations**: Target <200ms (login, token validation, password verification)
- **Database Operations**: Target <100ms for user lookups
- **Pagination**: OFFSET pagination acceptable with reasonable limits (<100 per page)

### Security Standards

- **OWASP Top 10 Compliance**: Built-in guidelines and review processes
- **JWT Security**: Proper signing, expiration, secret management patterns
- **Password Security**: bcrypt with appropriate cost factors
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive sanitization patterns

### Pre-commit Hooks

Husky automatically runs checks before commits:
- TypeScript type checking
- ESLint linting (with cache for performance)
- Conventional commit message validation

### Commit Message Format

Follow conventional commit format:
```
type: description

# Examples:
feat: add user authentication
fix: resolve login validation bug
docs: update API documentation
```

Supported types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert

## Specialized Claude Agents

This template includes specialized Claude agents (`.claude/agents/`) for maintaining code quality:

### üß™ Testing Agents
- **Test Case Writer**: Analyzes code and generates structured test case documentation
- **Test Implementation**: Implements tests based on documented cases (runs AFTER Test Case Writer)

### üîí Security & Architecture
- **Security Review**: OWASP Top 10 compliance analysis and vulnerability detection
- **Architecture Compliance**: Clean Architecture validation and layer boundary enforcement

### ‚ö° Performance & PR Management
- **Performance Analysis**: Bottleneck identification and SLA enforcement
- **PR Preparation**: Pre-PR quality checks and Git Flow validation
- **PR Review**: Comprehensive GitHub PR review with structured feedback

### Usage Guidelines
- Use agents proactively throughout development
- Test Implementation Agent requires Test Case Writer to run first
- Security and architecture agents have zero tolerance for violations

## Testing

### Structured Testing Workflow

This template implements a structured testing approach using specialized agents:

1. **Test Case Writer Agent**: First, analyze code and document test cases
2. **Test Implementation Agent**: Then, implement tests based on documented cases

### Running Tests

```bash
# Unit tests
pnpm run test

# Specific test file
pnpm run test -- user.service.spec.ts

# With coverage
pnpm run test:cov

# E2E tests
pnpm run test:e2e
```

## Environment Variables

Configure your environment by creating a `.env` file from the template:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

The application uses **Joi validation** to ensure all environment variables are properly configured with strict validation rules:

### Validation Features

- **Database Configuration**: Hostname and port validation for PostgreSQL connection
- **Cache Configuration**: Redis hostname and port validation with optional password
- **JWT Security**: All secrets must be minimum 32 characters, TTL values must be positive integers
- **Email Configuration**: SMTP hostname, port, and email format validation
- **Strict Type Checking**: All variables validated for correct data types and formats
- **Clear Error Messages**: Detailed validation errors with specific requirements
- **Startup Validation**: Application fails fast if any required variable is missing or invalid

See `.env.example` for all required variables and their expected formats. If validation fails, the application will throw detailed error messages indicating which variables need attention.

## Deployment

### Production Build

```bash
# Build for production
pnpm run build

# Start production server
pnpm run start:prod
```

### Docker Production

```bash
# Build production image
docker build -t boilerplater .

# Run with environment variables
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env boilerplater
```
